= Kevin J. Leahy -- About Me

I am an Assitant Professor in the Robotics Engineering Department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Befor that, I was a member of the Technical Staff at [http://www.ll.mit.edu MIT Lincoln Laboratory] from 2017 to 2023. My research focuses on robotics and autonomous systems, specifically the intersection of formal methods, planning, controls, and machine learning. 

I earned a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Boston University in January 2017.
My work was supervised by Professor Calin Belta of the [http://sites.bu.edu/hyness/ Hybrid and Networked Systems Lab] (now part of the [http://sites.bu.edu/robotics/ BU Robotics Lab])  and Professor Mac Schwager of the [https://msl.stanford.edu/ Multi-Robot Systems Lab].
Prior to that, I worked for a health economics consulting firm for several years, following my undergraduate degree in Economics with a minor in French from Boston University in 2009.

My personal interest include distance running and woodworking.
I am also an avid cinephile, spending much of my free time at the Boston area's many excellent independent movie houses.
