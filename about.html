<h1>Kevin J. Leahy &ndash; About Me</h1>
</div>
<p>I am a member of the Technical Staff at <a href="http://www.ll.mit.edu">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a>. My research focuses on robotics and autonomous systems, specifically formal methods and multi-agent systems. 
I earned a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Boston University in January 2017.
My work was supervised by Professor Calin Belta of the <a href="http://sites.bu.edu/hyness/">Hybrid and Networked Systems Lab</a> (now part of the <a href="http://sites.bu.edu/robotics/">BU Robotics Lab</a>)  and Professor Mac Schwager of the <a href="https://msl.stanford.edu/">Multi-Robot Systems Lab</a>.
Prior to that, I worked for a health economics consulting firm for several years, following my undergraduate degree in Economics with a minor in French from Boston University in 2009.</p>
<p>My personal interest include distance running and woodworking.
I am also an avid cinephile, spending much of my free time at the Boston area's many excellent independent movie houses</p>
